# Contributing Guide

Thank you for your interest in KeyCompute. Contributions are welcome across code, documentation, bug reports, feature requests, and project feedback.

This guide is written for the current repository layout and workflow. If a command here conflicts with the codebase, follow the codebase and open a documentation fix.

## Ways to Contribute

- Fix bugs or improve existing behavior
- Add tests for uncovered scenarios
- Improve documentation and examples
- Add or refine provider integrations
- Report bugs, edge cases, or usability issues
- Propose new features or architectural improvements

## Before You Start

- Read [README.md](README.md) for the product overview and local development commands.
- Search existing issues and pull requests before starting duplicate work.
- Keep changes focused. Small, reviewable pull requests are much easier to merge.

## Development Environment

### Stack

- Backend: Rust, Axum, Tokio
- Frontend: Dioxus 0.7
- Database: PostgreSQL 16+
- Cache / rate limiting: Redis 7+

### Prerequisites

- Rust stable toolchain
- Docker and Docker Compose for local services
- `dioxus-cli` for frontend development

Install the Dioxus CLI if you plan to work on the web frontend:

```bash
curl -sSL http://dioxus.dev/install.sh | sh
```

## Local Setup

### Option 1: Run the full Docker Compose stack

This is the easiest way to get the project running end to end.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/keycompute/keycompute.git
cd keycompute

cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and replace all placeholder secrets before real deployments

docker compose up -d
```

### Option 2: Run backend and frontend locally

Use this setup when you want a faster edit / run loop.

1. Copy the local config template:

```bash
cp config.example.toml config.toml
```

An ordinary `cargo run` creates a debug binary, which is always in development
mode. It reads only `config.toml`, listens on `0.0.0.0`, and may use the public
local credentials shown in the template.
`.env.example` and `KC__*` variables are Compose inputs; do not source `.env`
for this `cargo run` workflow.

2. Start the local dependencies:

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env.example -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d postgres redis
```

3. Start the backend:

```bash
cargo run -p keycompute-server
```

4. Start the web frontend in another terminal:

```bash
dx serve --package web --platform web --hot-reload true --addr 0.0.0.0
```

Notes:

- The backend initializes the embedded schema on startup. Database upgrades are intentionally unsupported: recreate the database after schema changes.
- `config.toml` is the only application configuration source for an ordinary
  debug `cargo run`; `KC__*` and `APP_BASE_URL` do not override it. A release
  binary (including the Docker image) is always production, reads environment
  variables, and ignores `config.toml`. There is no runtime mode setting.
- If you work on password reset emails or public invite links, set
  `app_base_url` in local `config.toml`; release deployments use `APP_BASE_URL`.

## Code Quality Checks

Please run the same core checks used by CI before opening a pull request.

### Formatting

```bash
cargo fmt --all --check
```

### Linting

```bash
cargo clippy --workspace --exclude desktop --exclude mobile --all-targets --all-features --future-incompat-report -- -D warnings
```

### Tests

```bash
cargo test --lib --workspace --exclude desktop --exclude mobile --verbose
cargo test --package client-api --tests --verbose
cargo test --package integration-tests --tests --verbose
```

### Optional build check

```bash
cargo build --workspace --exclude desktop --exclude mobile --verbose
```

If your change touches `desktop` or `mobile`, run the relevant package commands in addition to the shared workspace checks.

## Contribution Expectations

### Rust and backend changes

- Follow the existing crate boundaries and dependency direction.
- Prefer small, composable changes over broad refactors.
- Add or update tests when behavior changes.
- Keep logging and error messages actionable.

### Example security configuration policy

- `.env.example`, `config.example.toml`, and the fallback values in the Compose
  files are development examples. Operators must override them for production.
- Production startup always rejects a blank/default JWT secret (minimum 32
  bytes) and a missing or invalid Provider API-key encryption key (Base64 for
  exactly 32 bytes). When Redis enables Node Gateway, it also rejects a
  blank/default node-registration secret shorter than 16 bytes. Only the first
  `system` administrator bootstrap requires a non-default, non-blank password
  of at least 12 characters; later restarts may omit that one-time secret.
- PostgreSQL, Redis, SMTP, and payment example credentials are not covered by
  the application placeholder checks. Operators must still replace them for
  production. Keep code, templates, and tests aligned with this contract.
- New example credentials must be clearly marked, remain overridable through
  documented configuration, and have tests that keep code, templates, and
  Compose fallbacks aligned.

### Frontend changes

- This repository uses Dioxus 0.7. Do not introduce older Dioxus APIs.
- Keep shared UI logic in `packages/ui` when it is platform-agnostic.
- Keep web-specific dependencies and behavior in `packages/web`.

### Database changes

- Update `crates/keycompute-db/migrations/001_init.sql`; it is the complete
  schema and the only SQL source of truth for fresh deployments.
- Update the relevant data models and query code in `crates/keycompute-db/src/models/`.
- Recreate the database after changing the baseline; incremental upgrades,
  compatibility migrations, and old-data backfills are not supported.
- Verify the server can initialize an empty database and boot cleanly.

### Adding a new provider

Most vendors (DeepSeek, Ollama, vLLM, Gemini OpenAI-compat, etc.) do NOT need
new code: create a channel account with the matching protocol (`openai` or
`anthropic`) plus the vendor's base URL and API key.

Only when integrating a genuinely new wire protocol:

1. Create a protocol crate under `crates/llm-protocol/`.
2. Implement the `ProviderAdapter` trait from `llm-protocol-provider`.
3. Add the protocol to `ProtocolType` and register it in `keycompute-server`
   (`providers.rs`) and any required routing wiring.
4. Add tests for request mapping, stream parsing, error handling, and any
   protocol-specific behavior.

## Commits

- Use clear commit messages that explain what changed and why.
- Keep one logical change per commit whenever practical.
- Prefer English commit messages for consistency across the repository.

Example:

```text
feat: add DeepSeek provider streaming support

- implement provider client
- normalize streaming chunks
- add tests and update docs
```
