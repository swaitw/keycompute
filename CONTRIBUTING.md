# Contributing Guide

Thank you for your interest in KeyCompute. Contributions are welcome across code, documentation, bug reports, feature requests, and project feedback.

This guide is written for the current repository layout and workflow. If a command here conflicts with the codebase, follow the codebase and open a documentation fix.

## Ways to Contribute

- Fix bugs or improve existing behavior
- Add tests for uncovered scenarios
- Improve documentation and examples
- Add or refine provider integrations
- Report bugs, edge cases, or usability issues
- Propose new features or architectural improvements

## Before You Start

- Read [README.md](README.md) for the product overview and local development commands.
- Search existing issues and pull requests before starting duplicate work.
- Keep changes focused. Small, reviewable pull requests are much easier to merge.

## Development Environment

### Stack

- Backend: Rust, Axum, Tokio
- Frontend: Dioxus 0.7
- Database: PostgreSQL 16+
- Cache / rate limiting: Redis 7+

### Prerequisites

- Rust stable toolchain
- Docker and Docker Compose for local services
- `dioxus-cli` for frontend development

Install the Dioxus CLI if you plan to work on the web frontend:

```bash
curl -sSL http://dioxus.dev/install.sh | sh
```

## Local Setup

### Option 1: Run the full Docker Compose stack

This is the easiest way to get the project running end to end.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/keycompute/keycompute.git
cd keycompute

cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and replace all placeholder secrets before real deployments

docker compose up -d
```

### Option 2: Run backend and frontend locally

Use this setup when you want a faster edit / run loop.

1. Copy the local config template:

```bash
cp config.toml.example config.toml
```

2. Start the local dependencies:

```bash
docker compose up -d postgres redis
```

3. Start the backend:

```bash
cargo run -p keycompute-server --features redis
```

4. Start the web frontend in another terminal:

```bash
API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000 dx serve --package web --platform web --addr 0.0.0.0
```

Notes:

- The backend automatically runs embedded SQLx migrations on startup. You do not need a separate migration binary for normal development.
- `config.toml` is intended for local development. Environment variables override values from `config.toml`.
- If you work on password reset emails or public invite links, set `APP_BASE_URL` explicitly.

## Code Quality Checks

Please run the same core checks used by CI before opening a pull request.

### Formatting

```bash
cargo fmt --all --check
```

### Linting

```bash
cargo clippy --workspace --exclude desktop --exclude mobile --all-targets --all-features --future-incompat-report -- -D warnings
```

### Tests

```bash
cargo test --lib --workspace --exclude desktop --exclude mobile --verbose
cargo test --package client-api --tests --verbose
cargo test --package integration-tests --tests --verbose
```

### Optional build check

```bash
cargo build --workspace --exclude desktop --exclude mobile --verbose
```

If your change touches `desktop` or `mobile`, run the relevant package commands in addition to the shared workspace checks.

## Contribution Expectations

### Rust and backend changes

- Follow the existing crate boundaries and dependency direction.
- Prefer small, composable changes over broad refactors.
- Add or update tests when behavior changes.
- Keep logging and error messages actionable.

### Frontend changes

- This repository uses Dioxus 0.7. Do not introduce older Dioxus APIs.
- Keep shared UI logic in `packages/ui` when it is platform-agnostic.
- Keep web-specific dependencies and behavior in `packages/web`.

### Database changes

- Add new migration files under `crates/keycompute-db/src/migrations/`.
- Update the relevant data models and query code in `crates/keycompute-db/src/models/`.
- Verify the server still boots cleanly, because migrations run during startup.

### Adding a new provider

When adding a new LLM provider:

1. Create or update the provider crate under `crates/llm-provider/`.
2. Implement the traits from `keycompute-provider-trait`.
3. Register the provider in `llm-gateway` and any required server wiring.
4. Add tests for request mapping, error handling, and any provider-specific behavior.

## Commits

- Use clear commit messages that explain what changed and why.
- Keep one logical change per commit whenever practical.
- Prefer English commit messages for consistency across the repository.

Example:

```text
feat: add DeepSeek provider streaming support

- implement provider client
- normalize streaming chunks
- add tests and update docs
```

## Pull Requests

### Submission flow

1. Fork the repository and create a branch from `main`.
2. Make your changes and run the relevant checks.
3. Push your branch.
4. Open a pull request with a clear description.
